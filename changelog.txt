Date: 18.08.2019

  Changes:
    - Re-worked the code as suggested by Optera - thank you
    - Changes to the car entity are not made in the data-final-fixes.lua so should be competible with other car modes

  To Do:
    - make a setting to determin the scale
    - make a hotkey for the high beam
    - make another hotkey for floodlights around the car (For combat ?)
